RISC-Veety -- 32-bit risc-ish architecture

synopsis:
	this is a 32-bit arch meant to experiment with a different
	kind of addressing mode, hopefully allowing timesharing but
	without using any type of virtual memory.

registers:
	R0..R7		-- general purpose registers
	OP, C0		-- offset pointer
	CP, C1		-- co-processor status register (see below)
	PC, C2		-- program counter
	SP, C3		-- stack pointer
	FP, C4		-- frame pointer
	SV, C5		-- syscall vector
	FV, C6		-- interrupt vector
	FL, C7		-- control register
		0:		priv mode (0 = system, 1 = user)
		1:		addressing mode (0 = absolute, 1 = relative)
		2:		interrupt mode (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled)
		3:		test flag (1 if last comparison was true, 0 otherwise)
		4..7:	interrupt number
		8:		int flag (set if an interrupt is thrown)
		9:		overflow
		10:		divide by zero
		11..31:	unused

instruction encoding:
	struct {
		u4int len		// length of args (in bytes)
		u4int mod		// operation modifier (width, jump type, etc)
		u8int opcode	// opcode
		u8int args[len]	// instruction arguments
	}
	instructions can be at most 18 bytes long.

(registers are encoded in 4 bits. consts and addrs are 32-bits)
[reg = 0.5 bytes, consts and addrs are 4 bytes]
{all instr are intel syntax aka name dest, src}

instructions: [lengths are total instruction length. length field value is l-2]
(l	cd[.mod]	args)
	(description)

modifiers:
		0x0 = no modification
	c =	0xf = conditional execution (see below)
	w = width
		0x1,b = 8-bit op (byte)
		0x2,h = 16-bit op (half-word)
		0x3,w = 32-bit op (word)
	m = addressing
		0x4,a = absolute memory op
		0x8,r = relative memory op
	all unmodified instructions are 32-bit and use the current
	addressing mode

Interrupts and system calls
	there are four types of interrupts: system calls, software interrupts,
hardware interrupts, and the continuation interrupt.

system calls
	system calls are unmaskable. when a system call happens, FL, OP, and PC
are pushed to the stack, then FL:0 and FL:1 are unset then the proc jumps
to SV. on a syscall return PC, OP, and FL are popped from the stack.

software and hardware interrupts
	these interrupts are the same as system calls, but can not happen if FL:2
not set. interrupts, in addition to the system call set up, set FL:8 and
the interrupt number in FL:4..7. software interrupts always set FL:4..7 to
0xf.

continuation interrupts
	these are transparent to the programmer. they just allow the processor to
continue execution after a coprocessor call or hlt. these are fired off by
hardware devices.

conditional execution
	All instructions can be prefixed with the conditional execution mode.
Conditional execution only allows the instruction to be executed if the
test flag (FL:3) is set. Limitations of this are that you can not use
anything beyond the default modes on an instruction because the conditional
execution mode is represented by having the mode field set to 0b1111, meaning
both fields can not be decoded.
